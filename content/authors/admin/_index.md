I am a B.Sc. student at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) majoring in computer engineering with a focus on software. Through my years as an undergraduate student, I have become quite interested in artificial intelligence as the subject of my graduate studies. That is why I am currently working on my bachelor's thesis on the subject of [adversarial examples](https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/) under the supervision of [Dr. Araabi](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~araabi). I am particularly interested in this area of research because adversarial examples are not only serious threats to AI safety, but also systematic flaws that offer an insight into the inner-workings of deep models through the investigation of their causes. My broader research interests include machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, as well as knowledge representation and reasoning. I recently took an internship at [Sensifai](https://sensifai.com/#partners) to familiarize myself with AI in industry.

In addition to artificial intelligence, I also love writing software which is why I took an internship as a back-end developer in the summer of 2017

Aside from my academic interests, I also love writing software which
